# Leet-Code-Soulutions
  ## In This repository I will solve a bunch of problems using c++ language

### **Nots**
  - This Repo does not contain project contain files (each Problem In File)
  - Each file inside it link to problem
  - Try solve Problem before see answer 
  - Don't be bound by the existing solution, think outside the box ( if Can't solve it, take a look solustion then try write code)
  - if you can solving problem prefers see the solution ( to git new ideas This will make you stronger )
